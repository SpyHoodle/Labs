Our core beliefs.

## Manifest

### Reliance
We are too reliant on others, such as the government for our supplies and lifestyles.

We are taught that we cannot do anything ourselves, and that we need to get a job to earn money,
to then spend on things that we couldn't do ourselves (i.e. repairs, water and food, housing, etc.)
While it is true that we cannot possibly learn absolutely everything, and do completely everything
ourselves, we can make it much easier for ourselves to do things without specialist help, or the
help of governments or the current economic system we live in.

### Lack of Development
Progress has halted, and it seems the infrastructure of the world has become reliant on poor
software and science which is not only damaging us but slowing us down. Smart people get caught
up in big tech jobs instead of in research centres, like the long gone Bell Labs.

## Philosophy
We want to be able to create, fix and hack things by ourselves, and continue the research into
niche topics which we believe are still vital and useful to us and others today.

### Learning
Continuously improving and optimising everything we do is vital. We learn new things to become
knowledgeable and strong. We want to do things by ourselves, with a lack of reliance on others
or governments. This helps us for preparation, and makes us smarter and better to protect and
develop.

### Protection
Keeping ourselves safe and protecting each other is a key value. We need to be prepared for
anything and know how to deal with unfortunate but possible situations where there may be
no-one else able to help. We keep ourselves and our people safe, through methods such as:

- Preparing resources for a collapse of stability
- Creating and enforcing strong methods of communication
- Improving existing structures, or replacing them entirely

### Development
We want to develop the future into a habitable one, where people have rights and skills to
bring to the table. We're interested in science, engineering, technology and mathematics
and frequently design and develop inventions, programs or ideas to fix or replace their
worse counterparts. We want to go about fixing the harmful things that currently exist
in our environment.
